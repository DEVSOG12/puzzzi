# puzzzi

## Inspiration

We love Flutter! The best way to express our love for the flutter is to solve for Dash! Dash is our favorite mascot and the inspiration for “Puzzzi”!

## What it does
Puzzzi is a multiplatform puzzle game with animations that offers real-time leaderboards, level modes, and solving for Dash. Puzzzi shows our love for Flutter, by solving for Dash, “our favorite mascot”! Get points by solving puzzles and even more points by solving larger boards. Want more points? Solve it faster! The faster you solve the puzzle the more points you get! Unlock new boards by leveling up and get bonus XPs when you complete each level. Compete with your friends on the leaderboard and be among the top 10 in the world! Dark Mode or Light Mode? You can also set your desired theme to your preferred game theme. Need more practice? Try the free mode! You can practice without being timed and get scored!


## How we built it

We worked extensively on Flutter Web making sure it can be easily accessed on various web browsers and device screens! The game is written purely in Dart with the help of Firebase as the backend. 


## Challenges we ran into
A major challenge we faced and are currently still battling is with Desktop Frameworks! Unfortunately, Firebase Auth is currently not compatible with Flutter Desktop Frameworks. We have been looking into other substitutes to fix this `firedart`. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully built the game to work properly and responsively on all platforms. We are also really proud of the amount of work we need in such a little time. Considering that we are presently full-time students.


## What we learned

We learned so much from the development! We learned more about how firebase works and how we can use animations more efficiently on web.

## What's next for Puzzzi
As for the development of the game, we will continue to update it with more and more features and improve our user experience.
